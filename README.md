# test

This is a test repo.

In Kernel teams, whenever a series of featured sessions or regular sessions are hosted, create a repo for the series. The repo will include:
- all the document of the session (`.md` files)
- README includes the **instruction on how to use the documents**(if they are obsidian or regular, etc.) and **links to member works**

This helps archive and access of materials for future leaders and members.
